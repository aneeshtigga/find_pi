# Find Pi
### This Python code will estimate the value of Pi based on the size of the parameter.
Higher the value of the parameter, the more accurate the Pi value will be.<br>

Run on [Python 3.7.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-376/) or higher versions

## Usage
```bash
$ python -i find_pi.py
```
<br>

Call the function <b>find_pi</b> with appropriate parameters

```python
>>> find_pi(10000)
3.1304
```

<i>Note: The higher the value you put in, the more compute power it'll need to generate the Pi value</i><br><br>
